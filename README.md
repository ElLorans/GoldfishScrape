Download MtgGoldfish Decklists as json file

Run goldfishscrape.py. Insert the format you want to scrape (e.g.: Modern). The screen will show all the urls being scraped.
The script will ask if you want to save the output. If "yes" is inserted, you will get 2 files: modern_m.json including
a dictionary with all the Modern mainboards and modern_s.json including a dictionary with all the Modern sideboards.
